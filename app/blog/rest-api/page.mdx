# Resilient Event-Driven Microservices Architecture with CI/CD

In this project, we built a microservices-based system that synchronizes user and order data using an event-driven approach, Docker containerization, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Architecture Overview

Our solution comprises several key components:
- **User Microservices (v1 & v2):** Two versions managing user data with CRUD operations, where updates trigger synchronization events.
- **Order Microservice:** Manages order processing and maintains data consistency by updating records based on user events.
- **API Gateway:** Routes HTTP requests and implements the strangler pattern to smoothly transition traffic from v1 to v2.
- **Event-Driven System:** Uses RabbitMQ to enable real-time data synchronization between services.
- **Data Storage:** MongoDB is used for scalable storage of user and order data.

## Microservices Implementation

### User Microservices
- **Version 1 (v1):**
  - Provides basic user creation and update operations.
  - Stores user information (userId, email, deliveryAddress) in MongoDB.
  - Publishes update events to RabbitMQ for data synchronization.
- **Version 2 (v2):**
  - Enhances v1 with stricter data validation and additional endpoints.
  - The API Gateway routes a configurable percentage of traffic to v2, enabling a seamless migration via the strangler pattern.

### Order Microservice
- Manages orders including order ID, product details, status, and user-related data.
- Listens for user update events from RabbitMQ and updates the order records in real time.

---

## Event-Driven Synchronization with RabbitMQ

- **Mechanism:**  
  When user data (email or delivery address) is updated, an event is published to a RabbitMQ queue. The Order Microservice consumes these events to update its records immediately.
- **Benefits:**  
  Ensures real-time data consistency and decouples the user and order services, enhancing overall system resilience.

---

## Strangler Pattern for Seamless Migration

- **Implementation:**  
  The API Gateway uses a configurable parameter (P) to route a specified percentage of user requests to v1 and the remainder to v2.
- **Advantage:**  
  This strategy allows for gradual migration from the old to the new version without downtime, ensuring continuous service availability.

---

## Docker Deployment and CI/CD Integration

- **Containerization:**  
  Each component—including the API Gateway, both User Microservices, the Order Microservice, and RabbitMQ—is containerized using Docker. Docker Compose orchestrates these containers for smooth deployment.
- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  The entire system is deployed on a cloud VM, with public endpoints exposed for API access.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment. On each commit, the CI/CD workflow builds the Docker containers and deploys them, ensuring rapid and reliable updates.

---

## Experimental Results

- **Functional Testing:**  
  All microservices correctly handled CRUD operations, and updates in user data were synchronized to the order database in real time.
- **Performance Metrics:**  
  - Average response times remained low under normal load.
  - Event processing delays were minimal, ensuring timely updates.
- **Strangler Pattern Efficiency:**  
  Dynamic traffic routing between v1 and v2 was achieved without service disruption.
- **Deployment Robustness:**  
  The Docker-based environment and CI/CD pipeline provided efficient scaling and seamless, automated deployments.

---

## Conclusion

By integrating microservices, an event-driven system with RabbitMQ, and automated CI/CD workflows, our architecture achieves scalable, resilient, and real-time data synchronization between user and order systems. The use of the strangler pattern further ensures smooth migration between service versions, making the solution both robust and future-proof.
