## Architecture Overview

Asteroids developed by Atari and self published in the year 1979 is a video game classic. The gameplay consists of the player steering a triangular spaceship, with the goal of destroying asteroids by shooting them.

What follows is a larger scale example, where I create a part of the Asteroids game. The game is also an exercise in the JAVA MOOC course.
The game is constructed in multiple parts, which are the following:

- **Creating the game window**
- **Creating the ship**
- **Turning the ship**
- **Moving the ship**
- **Creating an asteroid**
- **The collision between the ship and an asteroid**
- **Multiple asteroids**
- **Staying within the window**
- **Projectiles**
- **Adding points**
- **Continuous adding of asteroids**

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Java**: The core language used for game logic and object-oriented programming structure.
- **JavaFX**: Used for building the graphical user interface, rendering game elements (ship, asteroids, projectiles), and handling real-time animations.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project leverages key OOP principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation to model game entities like `Ship`, `Asteroid`, and `Projectile`.
- **AnimationTimer (JavaFX)**: Enables a consistent game loop and real-time updates for motion and collision detection.
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: JavaFX `KeyEvent` listeners allow users to control the ship (rotate, thrust, and shoot) using keyboard input.
- **Collision Detection**: Basic geometric intersection logic is used to detect when asteroids and projectiles collide.
